# Motivation
I'm sharing this old university project to help any computer science student (or any interested person) whos trying to code for the Lego Mindstorms with the NXC language. This code was written long ago by me and two partners to win a course contest. We never cared about refactoring nor commenting the code (sorry about that), any contributions on that matter will be welcomed.
